# Simple-Classic

This is a theme for Publii version 0.46.x and higher.  It supports the new pages introduced with version 0.46.0.  This theme updates the original Simple theme for Publii.  It has been renamed Simple Classic to avoid confusion with the newest Simple theme released with the version 0.46.0 of Publii.

## Pages support
This theme now supports pages and has support to display child pages that are related to a specidic page.
